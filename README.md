# MyContract

This Solidity program is designed to calculate the percentage obtained by a student based on their marks and assign a grade accordingly. It demonstrates more advanced functionalities of the Solidity programming language, such as state variables, functions, and error handling. The purpose of this program is to provide a practical example of how Solidity can be used for real-world applications.

## Description

This contract is written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has functions to calculate the percentage of marks obtained, determine whether the student passed or failed, and assign a grade based on the percentage. This program serves as a detailed example of Solidity programming and can be used as a foundation for more complex projects in the future.

## Getting Started

### Executing the Program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at [https://remix.ethereum.org/](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

1. **Create a New File:**
    - Click on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar.
    - Save the file with a `.sol` extension (e.g., `MyContract.sol`).

2. **Copy and Paste the Provided Code:**

3. **Compile the Code:**
    - Click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar.
    - Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to the appropriate version.
    - Click on the "Compile MyContract.sol" button.

4. **Deploy the Contract:**
    - Click on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar.
    - Select the "MyContract" contract from the dropdown menu.
    - Click on the "Deploy" button.

5. **Interact with the Contract:**
    - Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the `calculatePercentage` and `generateResult` functions.
    - Enter the marks obtained and total marks for `calculatePercentage`, then click on the "transact" button.
    - After calculating the percentage, call the `generateResult` function to get the grade.
